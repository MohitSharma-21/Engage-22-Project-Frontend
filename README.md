# Engage-22-Project-Frontend

## Introduction

In this project, I have used:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Tailwind css
- [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) for face recognition
- Deployed the app on vercel [https://picture-and-todo-manager.herokuapp.com/](https://picture-and-todo-manager.vercel.app/)


### Setting up the project

Follow the following steps to setup this project.

**Note** - This task requires [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) which is a tool similar to npm.

### Run the server

- Clone this repo.
- Go the project folder in terminal.

Install the dependencies using
```
yarn install
```

Then you can finally run the server using this command.
```
yarn dev
```

Then you can go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit and save the file.
